# Project Documentation Blueprint

> This document serves as the master template for organizing all required project documentation before beginning development. It defines the standard set of documents that should be created for each new project, their dependencies, and their content requirements.

1. **prd.md**
   - This is the foundation document that defines what you're building
   - All other documents will reference requirements established here
   - Product vision and goals set the direction for technology choices
   - It will include:
      - Product vision and goals
      - User personas and stories
      - Feature requirements with priority levels
      - Success metrics/KPIs
      - Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability)
      - Compliance and security requirements
      - Regulatory considerations

2. **tech-stack.md**
   - Based on the PRD requirements, you select appropriate technologies
   - Technology choices influence database design, architecture, and development patterns
   - Integration patterns established here guide later implementation decisions
   - It will include:
      - Detailed justification for each technology choice
      - Version specifications
      - Integration patterns between technologies
      - Implementation constraints for each technology
      - References to official documentation
      - Service connection management
      - External service integrations
      - Caching strategies
      - Performance optimization techniques

3. **database-schema.md**
   - Follows after tech-stack since your database technology choice affects schema design
   - Core data models derive from product requirements in the PRD
   - Schema design influences both backend and frontend development
   - It will include:
      - Entity-relationship diagrams
      - Table definitions with field types and constraints
      - Indexing strategy
      - Query optimization guidelines
      - Data migration considerations
      - Connection pooling configuration
      - Security measures for data access
      - Data backup strategies

4. **app-flows.md**
   - Builds on the PRD user stories and the database schema
   - Defines how data and user interactions flow through the system
   - Helps visualize the application before development starts
   - It will include:
      - User journey diagrams
      - Critical path definitions
      - State transitions
      - Error and edge case handling
      - Success/failure paths
      - Authentication flows
      - Feature interaction maps
      - Background process flows

5. **backend-guidelines.md**
   - Depends on tech-stack decisions and database schema
   - Will reference the database schema
   - It will include:
      - API design principles
      - Authentication/authorization implementation
      - Error handling strategies
      - Middleware configuration
      - Service layer organization
      - Security measures (input validation, CSRF protection, etc.)
      - Logging and monitoring standards
      - Rate limiting and API protection

6. **frontend-guidelines.md**
   - Depends on tech-stack decisions and app flows
   - Will reference app flows for UI/UX considerations
   - It will include:
      - Component hierarchy
      - State management approach
      - Styling methodology
      - Responsive design specifications
      - Accessibility requirements
      - Client-side security practices
      - Performance optimization techniques
      - Server/client component boundaries

7. **implementation-plan.md**
   - Requires understanding of tech stack, app flows, and both frontend/backend guidelines
   - Orders development tasks based on dependencies established in previous documents
   - Provides the roadmap for how development will proceed
   - It will include:
      - Chronological development steps
      - Dependency ordering
      - Testing checkpoints
      - Approval gates
      - Incremental build verification steps
      - CI/CD implementation
      - Deployment procedures
      - Infrastructure setup process
      - Monitoring and observability setup

8. **directory-structure.md**
   - Follows the implementation plan document
   - Organizes files according to the chosen tech stack and development patterns
   - Aligns with both frontend and backend guidelines
   - It will include:
      - Complete file tree
      - Purpose of each directory
      - File naming conventions
      - Module organization principles
      - Reference to related components
      - Configuration file locations and purposes
      - Infrastructure files organization
      - Environment configurations

9. **maintenance-plan.md**
   - Developed after most technical decisions are documented
   - References all previous documents for comprehensive maintenance coverage
   - Includes testing strategy which spans across all components
   - It will include:
      - Testing strategy and coverage expectations
      - Monitoring and alerting strategy
      - Backup and recovery procedures
      - Incident management process
      - Release management
      - Technical debt management
      - Documentation update procedures
      - Future development roadmap
      - Security update process
      - Performance review cadence

10. **systems-prompt.md**
   - Created last as it references all other documents
   - Provides guidance on how to interpret and prioritize information in other documents
   - Establishes rules for AI interaction based on the complete project context
   - It will include:
      - Instructions for AI assistants on how to interpret project documents
      - Rules for code generation (consistency standards, error handling approaches)
      - Guidance on when to ask clarifying questions
      - Reference map to other documents
      - Project-specific constraints
